.SH NAME
docbook2texi-spec.pl \- convert DocBook Booksto Texinfo documents
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsgmlspl\fR \fBdocbook2man-spec.pl\fR


\fBnsgmls\fR [ \fB\fIsgml document\fB\fR ]\fB| sgmlspl\fR \fBdocbook2texi-spec.pl\fR [ \fB\fIbasename\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdocbook2texi\fR is a sgmlspl spec file that produces
GNU Texinfo documents from DocBook documents.  
.PP
The program reads ESIS produced by nsgmls (or other SGML parsers) from
standard input.  Currently the document element must be Book,
otherwise the results are undefined.
.PP
Its output, the converted Texinfo document, is written to standard
output.
.PP
The file \fIbasename.refs\fR will also
be created, which contains all the nodes in the document and their immediate
\&'child' nodes.  As node processing always require forward references,
\fBdocbook2texi\fR must be run twice for each document: the
first time to build the references, and the second to actually generate a valid
document.
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"

The SGMLSpm package from CPAN.  This package includes the sgmlspl script
that is also needed.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.PP
Trying \fBdocbook2man\fR on non-DocBook or non-conformant
SGML results in undefined behavior. :-)
.PP
This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.
.PP
This program does not come close to supporting all the possible markup
in DocBook, and may produce wrong output in some cases with supported
markup.
.SH "TO DO"
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
How the hell do you represent a backslash (\\) in Texinfo!!@?
I've tried \\\\ but TeX complains about it.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Fix breakages found in the test documents.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Add new element handling and fix existing handling.  
Be robust.  
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Make it faster. I think most of the speed problems so far is with parsing
ESIS.  Rewrite \fISGMLS.pm\fR with C and/or get input directly
from \fBSP\fR\&.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
There are some dependencies on elements occurring when they are actually
optional (according to the DTD).  We need to fix that (preferably) or 
prominently state the requirements.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Allow other more common document elements.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Separate out node referencing to a separate script.  Not only would it
make it faster/easier to maintain because it's separate from the main
code, but also I would like it to evolve into an automatic DocBook
ToC generator.
