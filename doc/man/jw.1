.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBjw\fR shell script allows to
convert a DocBook file (or some other SGML-based format) to
other formats (including HTML, RTF, PS and PDF) with
an easy-to-understand syntax. It hides most of Jade's
or OpenJade complexity and adds comfortable features.
.PP
Other scripts like \fBdocbook2html\fR,
\fBdocbook2rtf\fR or
\fBdocbook2ps\fR provide different ways of
calling \fBjw\fR that might be easier to
remember.
.PP
For the moment, jw does not handle XML, but only SGML.
.PP
This utility assumes that several other components are
installed. The list includes:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the ISO character entities for SGML
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
James Clark's DSSSL engine, jade, or an equivalent parser
like OpenJade
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
the DocBook DTD from the OASIS consortium
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Norman Walsh's DocBook modular style sheets (or some other
set of DSSSL style sheets)
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Sebastian Rahtz's jadetex set of TeX macros for jade
(for backends intended to "printing" formats like PDF, RTF or
PostScript)
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
A perl interpreter (for backends that use perl)
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
SGMLSpm from CPAN (for backends that use sgmls)
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Lynx HTML browser (for the \fItxt\fR
backend)
.PP
The jw script is basically called like this:

.nf
jw mydoc.sgml
.fi
.PP
where \fImydoc.sgml\fR is a SGML file.
.PP
The command line above uses default options: it converts
from DocBook (the default frontend) to HTML (the default backend),
does not put the result in a subdirectory (unless specified
otherwise in the style sheets), etc.
.PP
In this example, the "mydoc" file name as well as the ".sgml"
extension can be replaced by anything else. Current extensions
for SGML DocBook files include ".sgml", ".sgm", ".docbook", and
".db". The processed file \fImydoc.sgml\fR can
be in any other directory than the current one.
.PP
Here we have chosen to generate HTML output. In fact we can
use any of the backends stored in the \fIbackends/\fR
subdirectory of the DocBook-utils distribution directory (usually
\fI/usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.14\fR).
Similarly, you can use any frontend defined in the
\fIfrontends/\fR subdirectory to convert from another
input format.
.PP
This sample command creates one or many HTML files with
arbitrary file names in the current directory. This default behavior
can be changed through command line options and/or customization
style sheets.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options apply to the conversion script:
.TP
\fB   -f \fIfrontend\fB | --frontend \fIfrontend\fB  \fR
Allows to specify another frontend than default \fIdocbook\fR\&.
The list of currently available frontends is:
.RS
.TP
\fB\fIdocbook\fB\fR
Converts docbook with Norman Walsh's
style sheets. This frontend searches in the
subdirectories of the base SGML directory for a
file named \fIhtml/docbook.dsl\fR or
\fIprint/docbook.dsl\fR (depending on the
backend's type: html or print).
.RE
.TP
\fB   -b \fIbackend\fB | --backend \fIbackend\fB  \fR
Allows to specify another backend than default
\fIHTML\fR\&. The list of currently available
backends is:
.RS
.TP
\fB\fIdvi\fB\fR
Converts to DVI (DeVice Independant
files) by calling \fBJade\fR or
\fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fIhtml\fB\fR
Converts to HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) by calling \fBJade\fR
or \fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fIman\fB\fR
Converts a refentry to a Unix manual page
by calling docbook2man. Does not work with other SGML
document types than DocBook.
.TP
\fB\fIpdf\fB\fR
Converts to PDF (Portable Document
Format) by calling \fBJade\fR or
\fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fIps\fB\fR
Converts to PostScript by
calling \fBJade\fR or
\fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fIrtf\fB\fR
Converts to RTF (Rich Text Format)
by calling \fBJade\fR or
\fBOpenJade\fR\&. The resulting file can
then be inported into \fBMS Word\fR
or one of its Linux replacement programs.
.TP
\fB\fItex\fB\fR
Converts to TeX by calling \fBJade\fR or
\fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB\fItexi\fB\fR
Converts to GNU TeXinfo pages by calling
docbook2texi. Does not work with other SGML document types
than DocBook.
.TP
\fB\fItxt\fB\fR
Converts to a bare text file
by calling \fBJade\fR
or \fBOpenJade\fR, then
\fBLynx\fR\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB   -c \fIfile\fB | --cat \fIfile\fB  \fR
Allows to use an extra SGML Open Catalog that will list
other files like customization style sheets, adaptations to the
DocBook Document Type Definition, special character entities,
etc. This catalog is added to the list of catalogs determined
by the script (see option \fB--nostd\fR below)
.TP
\fB   -n | --nostd  \fR
Do not use the standard SGML Open Catalogs. Normally,
the standard catalogs list is determined like this:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
if the centralized catalog exists, then
use it. The centralized catalog is a list of all
catalogs that might be necessary that usually
resides in \fI/etc/sgml\fR\&. Its
name is provided by the frontend, for example
the \fIdocbook\fR frontend returns
\fI/etc/sgml/sgml-docbook.cat\fR\&.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Otherwise, take all the files
named \fIcatalog\fR from the
subdirectories of the SGML base directory (usually
\fI/usr/share/sgml\fR).
.RE
This option is useful in conjunction with the
\fB--cat\fR option to use only the catalogs that
are specified on the command line.
.TP
\fB   -d \fIfile\fB|default|none | --dsl \fIfile\fB|default|none  \fR
Allows to use a customized style sheet instead
of the default one.

A "target" starting with a hash mark "#" can be appended
to the file name. As a result, only the corresponding part
of the style sheet is executed (the "style specification" whose
"identificator" is equal to the target's name). A common use of this
mechanism is to define "#html" and "#print" targets to trigger
the corresponding part  of a replacement style sheet which is
common for both HTML and printout conversion.

By replacing the file name with "default", the default
style sheet provided with the frontend is used. For example, the
\fIdocbook\fR frontend returns 
\fI\&./docbook.dsl#html\fR (or
\fI\&./docbook.dsl#print\fR) in the SGML base
directory.

By replacing the file name with "none", no replacement
style sheet is used, not even the default style sheet. The style
sheet which is used is also determined by the frontend. For
example, the \fIdocbook\fR frontend returns
Norman Walsh's \fIhtml/docbook.dsl\fR (or
\fIprint/docbook.dsl\fR) found somewhere below
the SGML base directory.

If no --dsl option is specified, then "--dsl default" is
used.
.TP
\fB   -l \fIfile\fB | --dcl \fIfile\fB  \fR
Allows to use a customized SGML declaration instead
of the default one. The file name of the default SGML
declaration is not set for SGML files, and is set to
\fIxml.dcl\fR in the SGML base directory
for XML files.
.TP
\fB   -s \fIpath\fB | --sgmlbase \fIpath\fB  \fR
Allows to use another location for the SGML base
directory. This is the directory below which all SGML DTDs,
style sheets, entities, etc are installed. The default value
is \fI/usr/share/sgml\fR\&.
.TP
\fB   -p \fIprogram\fB | --parser \fIprogram\fB  \fR
Specify the parser to use (\fBJade\fR
or \fBOpenJade\fR) if several
are installed. If this option is not specified,
the script first tries to use Jade, then it tries
\fBOpenJade\fR\&.
.TP
\fB   -o \fIdirectory\fB | --output \fIdirectory\fB  \fR
Set output directory where all the resulting files will
be stored. If the style sheets define a subdirectory where to
store the resulting files too, the subdirectory defined by the
style sheets will be placed below the subdirectory defined by
this option.
.TP
\fB   -V \fIvariable\fB=[\fIvalue\fB]  \fR
Set a variable (to a value, if one is specified).
.TP
\fB   -u | --nochunks  \fR
Output only one big file. This option is useful only
when generating HTML, because the output can be split into
several files. This option overrides the setting that may be
done in the style sheets.
.TP
\fB   -i \fIsection\fB | --include \fIsection\fB  \fR
Declare a SGML marked section as "include". A SGML marked
section is a kind of conditional part of a document. If it is
declared "ignore", it will be left ignored, otherwise it will
be processed. An example of such a marked section would be:
.PP
.PP

.nf
            <DOCTYPE mydoc [
              <!ENTITY % confidential "ignore">
            ]>
            <mydoc>
              ...
              <![ %confidential [ Some confidential text... ]]>
              ...
            </mydoc>
            
.fi
.TP
\fB   -w \fItype\fB|list | --warning \fItype\fB|list  \fR
Enables or disables the display of given types of warnings.
Several -w options might be entered on the command line.
Warning types that start with "no-" disable the corresponding
warnings, the other types enable them.

If the warning type is replaced with "list", then
a list of allowed warning types is displayed.
.TP
\fB   -e \fItype\fB|list | --error \fItype\fB|list  \fR
Disables given types of errors.
Several -e options might be entered on the command line.
All error types start with "no-".

If the error type is replaced with "list", then
a list of allowed error types is displayed.
.TP
\fB   -h | --help  \fR
Print a short help message and exit
.TP
\fB   -v | --version  \fR
Print the version identifier and exit
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/sgml/sgml-docbook.cat\fB\fR
Centralized SGML open catalog. This file name might
vary if another frontend than \fIdocbook\fR
is used.
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.14/backends\fB\fR
